Description: Build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.

Steps:

- Data Collection: Gather movie ratings data from users, including movie IDs, user IDs, and ratings.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis.
- User-Item Matrix: Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and entries represent ratings.
- Collaborative Filtering: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms like User-Based or Item-Based methods.
- Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the recommendation system's accuracy.
- Top-N Recommendations: Generate top-N movie recommendations for a specific user.
- Interactive Interface: Create a simple web interface to allow users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
- Tech Stack:

Python
Data manipulation libraries (pandas)
Recommendation libraries (surprise)
Web framework (Flask or Django) for creating the interface
